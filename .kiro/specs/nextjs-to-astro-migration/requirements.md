# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration of a Next.js blog to Astro.js while preserving all existing functionality, content, and user experience. The current blog uses Next.js with Contentlayer for content management, TinaCMS for editing, Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for styling, and includes features like search, tagging, pagination, and project portfolios. The migration aims to leverage Astro's static-first approach for improved performance while maintaining feature parity.
