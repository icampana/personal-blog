  In collaboration with my company (then DOMO EC), we executed a migration from
  their proprietary web publishing system to a Drupal-based Content Management
  System (CMS). This involved developing a tailored content editing experience
  designed to optimize the publication workflow and enhance ongoing support for
  the news website of El Diario El Universo.
