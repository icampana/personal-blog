From Guayaquil to Porto: 20 years building the future of the web 🚀

I began my professional career in 2003 when the web was still defining its future. Since then, I've had the privilege of working on projects that impact millions of people: from digital media generating 10+ million monthly visits to fintech platforms empowering financial advisors with artificial intelligence.

## 💼 TODAY:

I lead development at [AssetLink AI](https://assetlink.ai/) (NY, USA), where we build a SOC2-certified fintech SaaS platform integrating AI/LLM (OpenAI, Google Gemini) with Vector Databases and custom agents. We connect financial advisors by integrating tools like Microsoft Dynamics and Salesforce with AI tools, creating a single source of truth that enhances decision-making.

## 🌟 MY JOURNEY:

• [G/O Media](https://g-omedia.com/): I was part of the development and maintenance team for iconic brands (Gizmodo, Kotaku, Lifehacker, The Onion), utilizing microservices architectures and handling millions of concurrent users.

• [Tentrr (USA)](https://www.tentrr.com/): I led the transformation from monolith to serverless, designing modern architectures on AWS.

• [BairesDev](https://www.bairesdev.com/), [WeKnow](https://weknowinc.com/): I developed solutions for US clients, implementing both communicative and transactional portals, including for large-scale enterprises.

• [DOMO (Co-founder)](https://domo.ec/): I led a team of 8 developers working with major Ecuadorian companies (Ecuavisa, El Universo, De Prati, Interagua).

## 🛠️ WHAT I DO:

I specialize in scalable architectures, clean code, and high-performing teams. I work with React, Node.js, Python, AWS, and now AI/ML. I have migrated legacy systems, optimized high-traffic platforms, and led distributed teams across 3 continents.

## 👨‍🏫 SHARING KNOWLEDGE:

*   Technical blog since 2004 (370+ articles) on development, architecture, clean code, and personal experiences.
*   Bootcamp instructor: Awana, Spotify Interview Preparation
*   Former university professor (Universidad Santa María - Guayaquil Campus, Casa Grande)
*   Mentor at Techstars Startup Weekend and Lean Startup Machine
*   Co-organizer of the first Drupal Camp in Ecuador

## 🌍 GLOBAL CITIZEN:

I work remotely from Porto with teams in the USA, Europe, and LATAM. I speak 4 languages (Native Spanish, English C2, Portuguese B2, French B2) and have collaborated with companies from Silicon Valley to Latin America.

My next challenge? To help teams and companies build products that truly matter, using best practices, modern technologies, and a people-centered approach.

## 👀 Fun Facts

Some highlights from my personal journey:

*   Management Computer Engineer from [Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María](https://www.usm.cl/) (Guayaquil Campus) with a diploma in Communication Applied to Advertising from [Universidad Casa Grande](https://www.casagrande.edu.ec/).
