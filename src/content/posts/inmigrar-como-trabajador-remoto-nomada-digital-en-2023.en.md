As of this writing, we are experiencing what the World Economic Forum in Davos defined as a "polycrisis"—multiple crises occurring simultaneously. This doesn't present a very encouraging scenario overall, but historically, it has always been significantly more impactful for LATAM (Latin America). Some of the converging factors include:

*   Global Inflation
*   Climate Change
*   Increase in Crime and Cybercrime
*   Post-Pandemic Effects
*   Ukraine/Russia Conflict
*   Supply Chain Crisis (Post-logistics crisis and pandemic effect)

In other words, we have a ticking time bomb whose effects no place will escape. The difference lies in how one experiences it and under what conditions, which is an advantage remote workers can leverage thanks to some of the current options.

The initial idea behind being a remote worker was not having to leave your country or move away from your family to secure a job in a company and/or industry where a) you were valued as a professional and b) it allowed you a better standard of living. However, in this case, I believe the paradigm shifts, and it also becomes an option to relocate to a place where living conditions might be better for me and my family.

## What has changed?

With the rise of digital nomads, some countries began opening their doors to welcome them, thereby attracting investment. The premise is that the income they receive comes from another country, requires no additional investment from the host country, and is directly injected into the local economy.

This trend existed even before the pandemic but significantly increased afterward, prompting other countries to consider similar policies and offer opportunities for remote workers to become permanent residents.

## What is required?

The requirements for applying for this type of visa will differ depending on the country. However, based on my knowledge and generalizing somewhat, they can be summarized as follows:

*   Proof of an employment contract with a company not located within the country to which you are applying (I would recommend that the contract be at least 6 months old).
*   A criminal record check from your current country of residence or where you have lived for at least the last year (this will vary depending on your country of origin). In Ecuador's case, this is obtained online and only needs to be apostilled by the regional government.
*   Demonstrate sufficient savings to cover living expenses for a period (assuming you unexpectedly lose your job). In cases like Portugal, they request the equivalent of at least one year of the minimum living wage (760 euros per month * 12 months).
*   Health insurance for the initial period of your stay in the territory. Many of these countries later offer the option to access their public healthcare system, but initially, one requirement is an active private insurance policy, and generally, it's better for our own peace of mind.
*   Proof of current tax residency (this may even initially exempt you from paying taxes in the new country). In Ecuador's case, this translates to providing at least your latest income tax declaration (which should match the value stated in your contract).
*   Bank statements for at least the last 3 months (also to confirm consistent salary reception).
*   Proof of accommodation. This requirement can change, but it refers to having a place to stay upon arrival. If you have a friend or family member in the country you wish to move to, a letter of invitation stating they will host you can be used. Otherwise, a rental agreement or at least a "commitment to rent" (where someone in the country signs, agreeing to rent you a space upon your arrival) is needed.

Generally, this summarizes the most important aspects. There will be some additional requirements depending on the country, but these are the first to review. It's important to note that these visas also allow for including family members. That is, I can apply with my remote job and extend the visa to my partner, children, parents, and in some cases, even siblings, though this will depend on the country, ages, etc.

## Where to look?

Some of the most interesting countries (from my perspective) for emigrating while maintaining a remote job and that eventually allow converting a digital nomad residence into permanent residency or citizenship are:

*   Portugal
*   Spain
*   Estonia
*   Colombia
*   Mexico
*   Indonesia
*   Malta

The primary elements I consider for this list are cost and quality of life (which includes safety), ease of access, taxes payable, and the option to convert it into permanent residency. For this list, I only selected countries where 1. the option exists and 2. one can live within the range of 700 to 1,600 per month (very generally).

Many more options exist, and surely more countries will offer these alternatives, but the choice of alternatives and what is most convenient will remain a personal one.

An excellent resource is the website [visadb.io](https://visadb.io/), where you can find experts in different countries, such as lawyers, tax specialists, migration consultants, etc., to assist with the migration process. By entering the visas section and selecting your country of origin, you can also see which visas offer the option to ultimately convert to citizenship (to live there permanently).
