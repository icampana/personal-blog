In the realm of technology professionals, a persistent discussion often centers on the criteria for transitioning between career levels, the number of distinct levels, and the implications of operating at each.

## Engineering Levels. Where Do I Stand?

The primary clarification needed is that, generally speaking, each company defines what constitutes a senior engineer according to its internal scale. Furthermore, many organizations employ their own leveling systems; some examples include:

*   Engineers: L1, L2, L3, L4, L5
*   Trainee, Junior, Mid Level, Senior
*   Engineer I, Entry Level, Mid Level, Senior Engineer, Staff Engineer, Principal Engineer
*   Software Engineer, Senior Engineer, Staff Engineer, Principal Engineer, Distinguished Engineer / Fellow

Some titles sound more grandiose than others, but ultimately, they all aim to represent a single concept: the level of maturity as a software engineer. This maturity can be assessed by one's ability to solve problems autonomously, analytical prowess, critical thinking, understanding of technology tools, knowledge of system design, and so forth.

The first point I wish to emphasize is that this is a process. One cannot rapidly transition from an entry-level position to a Senior role without having experienced and addressed diverse challenges.

Without delving into controversy, there are numerous discussions concerning those who developed their skills as self-taught individuals versus those who pursued a professional degree at a university or institute. Ultimately, the outcome truly depends on the individual.

I've encountered university-graduated engineers with minimal practical knowledge, as well as self-taught individuals who could outperform the top students from any educational institution.

## Knowledge by Level

To simplify understanding, the following generally represents what each level entails.

### Junior

*   Requires supervision
*   Possesses basic software and hardware knowledge.
*   Proficient in at least one programming language.
*   Participates in initial project planning.
*   Works on internal software features and tools.

### Mid Level

*   Capable of executing technical tasks with reduced supervision.
*   Clearly understands the development process, including analysis, development, deployment, etc.
*   Can set up a development environment independently.
*   Identifies errors during code analysis; can participate in peer reviews.
*   Can implement simple unit tests.

### Senior

*   Capable of supervising and leading a team of developers.
*   Able to comprehend project scope, plan, and estimate effort.
*   Mentors junior and mid-level developers.
*   Conducts peer code reviews.
*   Improves code structure and quality.

## What to Learn to Advance Your Career?

While some insights are gained solely through experience, other aspects of professional growth follow a fairly clear path. Indeed, this is precisely why many companies strive to define their engineering levels: to provide guidance and map out career progression within that trajectory.

Without overcomplicating the explanation, here are some key competencies required to advance to a higher level:

*   System Design
*   Algorithm Complexity Analysis (Big-O)
*   Scalability Considerations
*   Performance Optimization Tools

The first question some might pose is: "Which language should I learn?" or "Do I need to be an expert in a specific programming language to be considered Senior?"

The answer is: You are hired for your problem-solving ability, not for proficiency in a specific language or a diploma on the wall.

Over time, you can indeed become an "expert" in a particular area or technology, but this is not a prerequisite for being "Senior." Rather, professional experience and, what I personally consider most crucial, a clear grasp of foundational concepts are key.

At one of my previous companies, I was told: "We only look for good engineers; we know they can learn the rest" (assuming the first part is true, that they are good engineers). And it's true: with a strong foundation, everything else falls into place easily.

And by 'strong foundation,' I'm referring to competencies such as:

*   A thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms.
*   For web development, a deep knowledge of web engineering.
*   Understanding SCM (Software Configuration Management) and version control.
*   Comprehending design patterns.
*   Knowledge of clean code principles and how to develop maintainable solutions.

All these concepts are applicable across any spectrum, whether tied to a specific technology or a particular role, be it front-end or back-end.

However, it's not simply a matter of time—saying, "in 3, 5, or 10 years I'll be senior." Rather, it involves actively seeking out more situations where continuous learning and practical application of these skills are required.

In my particular career, this growth is largely due to my strong curiosity, combined with extensive experience working at development agencies, which compelled us to become familiar with a wide array of scenarios and situations.

## Seniority vs. Specialization

To conclude, a common point of confusion, which I mentioned earlier, is equating seniority with being a specialist in a particular tool, framework, language, or similar.

For example, if I've worked with React for 5 years and specialized in developing headless applications, does that make me a Senior React developer? In theory, it's highly probable, but not a guarantee, as it depends on the breadth and depth of experiences gained during that time.

Here are some questions that come to mind to help answer that:

*   Do you possess in-depth knowledge of the tool/framework/language?
*   Are you capable of making architectural design decisions for an application built with that technology?
*   Do you understand common problems and solutions within that type of development?
*   Are you clear on the advantages of implementing something using that tool versus any other, or simply not using it at all?

These may not be the perfect questions, but if you can answer them without difficulty, then yes, you are a senior specialist in that specific tool or language.
