In my professional experience, I've gone from being a business owner to enduring countless interviews to land the job I wanted. In both scenarios, it always comes back to the same core principle: you must know how to market yourself, because we need others to notice our "number one product" – ourselves.

To this, we can add a new variable in the current era: the possibility of remote work, especially for companies in the United States or Europe. In both cases, the primary mistake many Latin Americans make is not having a well-structured CV with clear information.

In this article, I will share a set of tips applicable to both a traditional CV and LinkedIn (which you should definitely leverage, especially if your goal is to secure international employment).

## Recommendations for an Active Job Search

### Multiple Languages

Maintain your CV in the languages relevant to the companies you wish to apply for. This applies to both remote work and relocation. For instance, if you aspire to live in Canada, I would strongly recommend having your CV in both English and French. Many companies hire in the Québec region, and submitting a French CV will significantly boost your chances.

If you're targeting the United States or looking to work abroad in general, having your CV available in English is the bare minimum. Specifically for LinkedIn, it offers the option to present your profile information in two or more languages. You don't need to re-enter all your data; enabling this option simply prompts you to translate the missing sections. The platform will then automatically display your profile in the viewer's preferred language, or default to English (which I highly recommend).

### Title, Headline, or What I Do

This applies to both traditional CVs and online profiles. It's advisable to explain concisely and clearly, in a single line, exactly what you do. This allows recruiters (head hunters) to quickly understand the type of profile they are viewing simply by reading that one line.

Furthermore, for electronic versions, the keywords you use here will be crucial for search engines to identify your profile.

Some examples:

* Senior Full Stack Engineer
* React Developer at X.Y.Z
* Technical Recruiter | Researcher | Bilingual
* SAP Process Analyst Specialist.
* Technical Lead - Mechatronics Engineer

With just a glance, it becomes clear what you currently do, along with any specializations or tools you master.

### About Me / Introduction

This is an area many often overlook, yet it's crucial. You need to write no more than 2-3 lines about who you are as a professional, highlighting your core skills and what value you can offer to your prospective employer.

You can add more information if you believe it enhances your profile, but those initial lines will likely be the only thing a recruiter or hiring manager notices. If those lines pique their interest, they will then proceed to read the rest. These individuals have limited time and need to extract the maximum amount of information quickly.

An important, though less common, point is that this introduction is about you as an individual. Therefore, it's best to write in the first person. I've seen some CVs written in the third person, which can make them feel overly "stiff" or detached, especially when targeting international companies that typically diverge from Latin American formality.

### Experience

In Latin American profiles and CVs, I believe this is the most common error and likely the section where I've observed the most mistakes or lack of information. Many individuals simply list their job title and dates at a company, sometimes with just a single line describing the role.

The first important point, especially when presenting your CV in another language to someone from another country, is that no matter how "big" a company's name seems to us, it's likely only well-known within our own country, unless it's a major multinational. If you don't translate your role to an equivalent (not a literal translation), it might not even be understood. Beyond this, what truly matters in professional experience is demonstrating the value you delivered or why you were valued in that company and role. Therefore, some key elements should be included at this level:

* One or two lines generally explaining the requirements of the role and what the company specializes in.
* A clear description of your contributions that can be considered achievements or advancements during that period – essentially, what made you "special." If you can quantify it, even better. Examples:

  * Successfully reduced operational costs by 10% after implementing X, Y, or Z activities.
  * In addition to my assigned role, I assisted the customer service team in improving response times by providing feedback and enhancing customer interaction.
  * I helped train team members to better organize their work using time management tools, which improved overall team performance.

Try (if possible) to include the hard skills you utilized to achieve these results as keywords. On LinkedIn, this will help recruiters find you when searching for individuals with specific required competencies, for example:
* Applied Techniques: Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), Advanced Excel, Statistics.
* Required Technical Skills: Python, React, Spark, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
* Tools Used: Pandas, Power BI, Tableau.

### Certificates and Badges

If you possess any certifications or credentials, now is the time to highlight them. However, avoid listing certifications merely for the sake of it; ensure they are relevant to the positions you are applying for.

Something easily applicable to both paper CVs and LinkedIn is leveraging language proficiency certificates. For English, tests like the EF Standard English Test, which can be obtained [for free from EF](https://www.efset.org/english-certificate), provide instructions for [adding it to your professional profile](https://www.efset.org/add-to-profile/) once completed.

A LinkedIn-specific feature is "Badges," which allow you to display validated knowledge. This means you can demonstrate proficiency in a 'hard skill' you've listed. These are typically 15-minute tests, primarily on technical subjects, but also include project management and other skills. Earning these badges helps your profile appear higher in search results when someone is looking for a specific skill.

### Projects

If your line of work allows the demonstration of completed projects, this provides tangible evidence of your accomplishments. For developers, the easiest approach is to showcase at least a screenshot of the finished product, a brief description of what was accomplished, and who you collaborated with (if it was a group effort). This also helps those individuals improve their CVs.

Once again, leverage this section to explain your individual contribution to the project, how your work had an impact or contribution. No contribution is too small; everything you've done or contributed adds value.

## Relevant Information

This is a final, but important, note: there's no need to clutter your CV with extraneous details. Focus primarily on what's crucial to your professional narrative. If you worked as a DJ 18 years ago but are now applying for a Project Lead position, that experience is unlikely to be relevant to your current job aspirations, unless it somehow connects – for instance, if it were a music production company. This ties back to time constraints; individuals reviewing your CV cannot dedicate extensive time to it, so they expect to see relevant and direct information.

Soft skills are important, but most recruitment processes already assess these during interviews. Therefore, including them extensively on your CV isn't paramount. I would recommend focusing more on highlighting your hard skills.
