## Where to Start?

One of the initial challenges when considering remote work is knowing where to begin the search, along with the question of whether there are opportunities for your specific skill set.

While it's true that the majority of remote job opportunities, or at least the easiest ones to find even before 2020, have been in the technology sector (software development, project management, design, UX, etc.), this doesn't imply they are the only options. Many other options and platforms exist. In this post, I will list some options that I believe are useful and offer a diverse range of opportunities.

Before diving into the job search and application process, I recommend taking some time to update your resume / CV using some of these [basic recommendations](/2022-03-24-tips-para-mejorar-tu-cv-y-mostrar-mejor-tus-capacidades/).

## Do I Need to Know English?

While not strictly indispensable, possessing at least a [B2 level](https://www.britishcouncil.es/ingles/niveles/b2) (according to the [CEFR](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Com%C3%BAn_Europeo_de_Referencia_para_las_lenguas) framework) significantly expands your opportunities in any country, including many where English is not an official language. However, there are also positions available for Spanish-only speakers, though typically not with the same salary levels or range of opportunities.

Can this be resolved quickly? Yes and no; it depends on your level of commitment and effort. The best example I've personally witnessed is a friend who advanced from an A2 to a B2 level in approximately 2 to 3 months, demonstrating tremendous dedication (2 hours daily plus 4 on Saturdays).

## What Type of Work to Look For?

Remotely, the most common working arrangements, while not the only ones, are:

*   **Contractor**.- This is a professional services arrangement, typically involving a fixed-term contract where a monthly payment or fee and working conditions (SOW / Statement Of Work) are agreed upon. One can work as a contractor in three main modalities:
    *   **Fixed-Value**, where a monthly fee is established.
    *   **Hourly Rate**, where compensation varies monthly but typically amounts to 160 hours (8 hours daily for 20 working days).
    *   **Project Milestones**, where payment is disbursed upon completion of each deliverable / project phase.
*   **Freelancer**.- The primary distinction of this modality is that one may be hired for a specific project, on an hourly basis, and occasionally extended or re-engaged by the same client. However, the underlying principle is a clearly defined, finite-term contract.

## Where to Look?

This is likely what most people are interested in: knowing where to find these job postings or vacancies. In the following list, I include the most popular options. Many are for finding work at Startups, others are for assistant roles, several are for IT, but there are also more generic platforms offering everything from virtual assistant positions to design and advertising jobs:

**_Note:_** _LinkedIn remains the benchmark for international companies, so it's essential to maintain a complete and well-structured profile, regardless of whether you apply through its_ [_jobs_](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) _option (which is also a viable choice)._

## Managing Job Applications / Offers

I'm adding this as an additional option: a tool that allows you to input job offers, view basic information, and log them on a dashboard where you can take notes and track progress.

[Huntr](https://huntr.co/) functions as a personal CRM. It's free for job seekers and has a cost for companies wishing to use it.

## How to Receive Payment?

This is another important consideration. Often, the main concern is how to receive payment for your services, as bank transfers can be costly or sometimes unavailable in all countries.

Two notable mentions I would consider are:

*   [Deel](https://deel.com/referrals/Ivan-v5m9Bzw5) .- is a platform that facilitates managing payments for remote employees, considering their country's location and local legislation, among other factors.
*   [Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/ivanc1094), .- allows you to hold a temporary U.S. bank account, where you can receive payments and then transfer funds to a local bank account in your country, convert them to another currency (e.g., from dollars to euros), or even use the funds with a debit card they issue (not available in all countries).

Again, many other options exist, but these are what I consider to be the most straightforward and effective at the time of writing this article.

A final note regarding job searches, whether remote or not, is the importance of focusing on highlighting achieved accomplishments and striving to differentiate yourself. Showcase your core capabilities, ensuring they are not solely limited to tasks performed, but also encompass learnings, achievements, and goals within previous experiences.
