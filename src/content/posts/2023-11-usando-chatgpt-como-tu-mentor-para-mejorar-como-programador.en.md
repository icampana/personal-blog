As a developer, we often have questions, especially if you're still a junior. One of the biggest fears is asking someone, and often we might think our questions are basic (especially when starting with a new technology). Sometimes we might feel like we're "bothering" the more senior members of the team, especially if senior members are focused on delivering critical features under tight deadlines. In such cases, having a reliable and "virtual" companion can make all the difference.

What if we use ChatGPT as a virtual tutor and reference guide to help us improve our programming skills? In this article, we'll explore how you can make the most of this powerful tool.

### An Ever-Available Virtual Mentor

One of ChatGPT's key benefits is its 24/7 availability. Encounter a programming problem at 3 AM? No problem. ChatGPT is there to provide guidance and answer your questions with the highest level of detail. Whether you're stuck on a specific line of code or grappling with a broader concept, ChatGPT is your always-ready tutor.

### Learning Through Conversation

Learning doesn't have to be a solitary task. Engage with ChatGPT in a conversation, ask about best practices, coding patterns, or seek clarification on complex topics. ChatGPT's interactive nature allows you to absorb information conversationally, making learning more engaging and enjoyable.

### How to Ask ChatGPT to Explain Code?

When asking ChatGPT to explain a code snippet, the key is to be clear and specific. Instead of simply presenting the code, formulate detailed questions about specific segments or concepts that you find confusing.

**Example**: "Can you explain how this 'for' loop works and why it's used in this context?" Provide additional context if necessary and break down your question into smaller parts to get more detailed explanations. Clarity in your queries will enable ChatGPT to offer you a more precise and detailed understanding of the code in question.

### Simplified Code Reviews

Upload snippets of your code and let ChatGPT review it. Get insights on how to improve efficiency, optimize logic, and adhere to best practices. It's like having a senior developer perform a quick code review whenever you need it. The feedback can be invaluable for refining your coding skills.

### Learn About New Technologies

Stay ahead of the curve by discussing emerging technologies and trends with ChatGPT. While ChatGPT's knowledge base is limited to 2021 at the time of writing this article, most frameworks or tools still in use were already available by that date. Alternatively, you can propose scenarios about what a technology entails and ask for a study plan to delve deeper into it.

**Example:**
"Hi ChatGPT! I'm exploring React.js for the first time. Could you explain key concepts like JSX and how components work together? Any tips for a beginner like me?"

### Usage Scenarios

Consider creating scenarios to simulate coding challenges. For example, if you're preparing for a job interview and want to practice, you can ask it to describe typical problems and/or classic questions of that style.

**Example**: I need to prepare for a technical interview as a junior Python developer specializing in the Flask framework. Could you provide a list of questions and a technical exercise to help me study?

### Other Tools?

Today, we can integrate ChatGPT or other AI-powered programming tools like [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot "Github Copilot") or [Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer "AWS Code Whisperer") within our IDEs to accelerate development. However, a tool I personally like is [Codeium](https://codeium.com/ "Codeium AI tool") because it's a hybrid: it allows me to ask questions about the code I'm viewing (just like you would with ChatGPT) directly within my editor, and you can also ask it to autocomplete code or provide suggestions for codebase improvements, and it's free. For enterprises, there's an option to provide an "on-premise" installation, eliminating the need for an internet connection and ensuring the privacy of the company's code (which is undoubtedly an important concern).

### Conclusion

In a world where information is at our fingertips, leveraging tools like ChatGPT can be a game-changer for junior developers. It's not a replacement for human interaction but rather a complement that offers constant support and valuable insights. So, the next time you encounter a coding dilemma, turn to ChatGPT and make the most of it.

##### **Legal Disclaimer:**&#xA;It is crucial to highlight that when using ChatGPT to review your code, it is essential to understand the associated legal implications. Although ChatGPT offers extremely helpful suggestions and revisions, it does not replace human judgment. We must be aware of the responsibility for the final interpretation and application of ChatGPT's recommendations in our code. Furthermore, it is essential to respect intellectual property laws and the platform's terms of service. This article does not constitute legal advice, and specific legal guidance is recommended to ensure regulatory compliance when using tools like ChatGPT in software development.
