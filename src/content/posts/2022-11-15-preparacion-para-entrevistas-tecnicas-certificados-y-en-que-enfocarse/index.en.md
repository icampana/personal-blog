Growing up in Latin America, we carry a certain cultural baggage that influences how we interact and communicate. When it comes to professional interviews, there are scenarios we're accustomed to. However, if we aim to work for a company in the US or Europe, we'll encounter a considerably different framework, especially concerning technical interview processes for IT-related roles.

In this article, I'll summarize key considerations from multiple perspectives, covering both purely technical aspects and human/social elements.

Each interview process will vary by company, some having more steps, others fewer. However, I'll focus on the most fundamental components:

* Cultural Match
* Technical Assessments
* Technical Interview
* System Design
* Final Interview / Negotiation

## Cultural Understanding / Cultural Match

This stage is typically the initial one. Prior to this, there might be a brief call with a recruiter to get to know you, understand your interests, and perform a basic check to see if your resume's qualifications align with the job posting. This call also serves as an initial inquiry to better understand you as a candidate. For roles requiring English, this is often where a quick validation of language proficiency occurs, especially when dealing with Latin American companies hiring for international positions.

The next part, known as the Cultural Match, simply refers to a few key points:

* Aligning with the company's organizational culture, mission, vision, and values.
* Understanding how the company operates and determining if you, as a candidate, can thrive within that environment.
* Identifying potential challenges within the company and assessing your willingness to embrace those challenges.

This might seem surprising – needing to understand a company before working for it. However, for an organization aiming to maintain productivity, harmony, and foster long-term employee retention, this mutual understanding is crucial.

To simplify, it's about mutual alignment: the company with the candidate, and the candidate with the company. It must be a bidirectional relationship, which isn't always something we're accustomed to. We often think we need to convince them to hire us based on our knowledge, but they also need to convince us that joining their company is worthwhile.

During this stage, I recommend being honest about your thoughts and aspirations, and asking all necessary questions to fully understand if this role and company are where you want to commit for at least a certain period.

One valuable tool currently available is Google's interview practice tool, which focuses on many typical questions that might arise during this stage:

* [Google Interview Warmup](https://grow.google/certificates/interview-warmup/)

Another critical tool for preparing for this stage is the STAR method, which helps organize your thoughts for explanations. It primarily involves explaining:

* S. Situation.- Set the scene by briefly describing the situation or problem you faced.
* T. Task.- Explain your responsibilities in that situation, the role you played.
* A. Action.- Describe the steps you took to overcome the challenge or situation you were in.
* R. Result.- Share what you achieved through your actions.

## Technical Assessments

The next stage you'll encounter involves completing multiple assessments tied to the position you're applying for. These can range from logic tests to algorithm knowledge checks (for programmer interviews), or even small projects requiring problem-solving.

Regarding online technical assessments, most are multiple-choice and self-graded. They aren't complex in the sense that you don't need to elaborate explanations, but correctly answering these questions requires a clear understanding of concepts and, of course, the experience outlined in the `JDs` (Job Descriptions).

For programming assessments, it's crucial to remember to focus less on the technically optimal solution and more on something that is maintainable, readable, and understandable by another person without additional explanation.

For reference, here are some typical questions you might encounter, depending on the language:

* [React Native](https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/react-native)
* [React](https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/react-interview-questions/)
* [Typescript](https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/typescript-interview-questions/)
* [Python](https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/python-interview-questions/)
* [Java](https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/java-interview-questions/)

Another option involves knowledge validation tests. Numerous platforms exist, some of the most well-known include: `HackerRank`, `Pluralsight`, `Leetcode`, `CodeChef`. Personally, I really appreciate Pluralsight's knowledge assessments; here are some of the common ones:

* [Java Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/java-fundamentals/intro)
* [Javascript](https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/javascript/intro)
* [TypeScript](https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/typescript/summary?context=profile)
* [Angular](https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/angular/intro?context=profile#/v2/landing)
* [Python](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/core-python)
* [React](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/building-web-applications-with-react)
* [Ruby On Rails](https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/building-web-apps-with-ruby-on-rails/intro)
* [Ruby](https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/ruby-language-fundamentals/intro)
* [Vue](https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/building-web-apps-with-vue/intro)

If you feel "rusty" and need to practice problem-solving and algorithms, I find HackerRank's material to be among the easiest to digest, allowing for gradual progress. Additionally, it's important to remember that for algorithm tests or interviews, you need a very fresh and clear understanding of the basics likely studied early in our careers, whether in university or through self-study, such as data structures, fundamental algorithms like sorting, searching, and data manipulation.

In Pluralsight's case, it provides a dashboard of your skills that is demonstrable and can serve as support during an interview. [I've included mine as an example](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/ivan-campana)

## Technical Interview / System Design

After passing the generally automated validations, we move on to the technical interview. There will be occasions where automated tests might be skipped, and we proceed directly to a live technical interview session, which is what I'm referring to in this step.

The key difference is that it's conducted with one or two interviewers who will review your CV and ask questions about how you would solve specific problems or situations, potentially including system design. For example:

* We want to design a new system that allows users to individually upload photos and share them with friends, applying effects before uploading (aka Instagram). How would you approach this solution?

What elements would you include? Whether at an infrastructure level, solution design in code, or just a general data flow diagram of the system. These are the types of answers expected at this level, perhaps with some sample code (nothing overly complex, just demonstrating that you can implement what you've conceptualized).

## Final Interview / Negotiation

At this point, we can almost say: "Throw the confetti, folks!"

If you've reached this stage, it's because they like your profile, you align with their technical requirements and work culture, and you're a good fit with the rest of the company. However, there are still a couple of things to understand.

Will I be a company employee, a `contractor`, or a `freelancer`? There's no wrong choice; it all depends on what you're seeking. Personally, I've worked as a `contractor` for about 6 years and prefer the freedom it offers in managing my own finances, expenses, and investments, but it's not for everyone. If you want to understand more about `Contractor` and `Freelancer` roles, I covered them in the article: [Where to Find Remote Job Opportunities](https://ivan.campananaranjo.com/posts/2022-10-01-donde-encontrar-ofertas-de-trabajo-remoto)

Another important consideration is the contract value. Typically, US companies discuss either an hourly rate or an annual salary. In LATAM, we're accustomed to a fixed monthly value. The quick way to calculate it if it's hourly is to multiply the hourly rate by 160 (an approximate number of hours in a month), e.g.:

* Hourly rate in `USD` 20, **monthly value** = 3,200, **annual value** = $ 38,400

From this, we must consider the conditions under which we'd feel comfortable. For example, deducting from this value (if desired): internet costs, health insurance, personal social security (in countries where voluntary contributions are possible), and vacation accrual. If, after all that, our **net** salary still satisfies us, then it sounds like a good offer. However, before blindly accepting a proposal, I'd recommend reviewing a [reference table of values](https://www.accelerance.com/hubfs/Accelerance%20-%202020%20Guide%20to%20Global%20Outsourcing%20Rates.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Accelerance%202020%20Guide%20to%20Global%20Software%20Outsourcing%20Rates&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=100147777&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_-c_YzMsErvj0Crpca0NBnVDlSu4si5YUF0Pooujfqm-rXW1Y8tWj_ISmAeC4MufocnxyERAb1xiwiyFFrxeI9vZx3dw&utm_content=100147777&utm_source=hs_automation), such as this one:

[![Rango de valores por hora segun la region](/photos/hourly-rates-per-region.png)](/photos/hourly-rates-per-region.png "Hourly Rates")

As a personal note, in my experience, remaining a contractor and paying for my own 'benefits' still represents a significantly higher value than what a local company might offer, thus maintaining a beneficial balance.

Some companies do directly offer benefits (perks), but the current market offers are highly varied. Therefore, I recommend against making a rash decision; instead, carefully consider what you want for yourself in terms of environment, professional challenge, and salary compensation. Ensure it's a well-thought-out decision.
