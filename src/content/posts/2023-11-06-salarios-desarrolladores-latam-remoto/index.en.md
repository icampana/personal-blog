If you're a software engineer in Latin America, a fundamental question likely on your mind is how much you could earn on average and how to manage your expenses as a contractor. In this article, I'll provide an overview of average developer salaries in the region and help you understand the fixed costs you might encounter.

An important consideration when writing this article is that, due to a confluence of current events (November 2023), salaries have adjusted significantly, experiencing a roughly 25% decrease across the industry. This is attributable to various factors such as post-pandemic shifts, geopolitical conflicts, market adjustments, and inflation.

Nevertheless, being a software developer working remotely from LATAM and earning in USD for companies in the US and/or Europe remains an attractive prospect. With that in mind, let's review the fundamentals.

## Average Salaries

*   **Junior Developers**: On average, junior developers can expect to earn around $3,300 to $4,200 per month.
*   **Mid-Level Developers**: Mid-level developers, with several years of experience, can anticipate monthly salaries ranging from $4,200 to $5,500.
*   **Senior Developers**: Senior developers, possessing significant experience and expertise, can earn between $5,500 and $6,500 per month.

While salaries in LATAM are considerably lower than those in the US, the cost of living there is also significantly higher. It's important to remember that these figures can vary based on country, city, and the specific technology stack you work with. The key, however, is to feel adequately compensated, including covering your fixed expenses (which I'll discuss next).

Furthermore, English proficiency is a factor that can influence a higher salary. To access these opportunities, a minimum English level of **B2** (according to the CEFR scale) is typically required.

If you want a clearer understanding of how to differentiate your current professional level, I've written an article on [Professional Maturity](https://ivan.campananaranjo.com/posts/madurez-profesional-en-ti-que-separa-a-un-junior-de-un-senior "Professional Maturity") that you might find helpful.

## Estimated Contractor Expenses

An important point that often causes hesitation for individuals considering remote work for foreign companies is that the engagement model typically involves contracting, meaning you operate as a service provider who invoices monthly, rather than a formal employee. While many companies are beginning to shift this paradigm by offering more benefits and security to foster long-term relationships, the standard approach remains contracting.

As a contractor, you must account for several fixed expenses to maintain your lifestyle and work efficiently:

*   **Health Insurance**: As a contractor, you will likely need to acquire your own health insurance. Costs vary depending on coverage level and country of residence but typically represent approximately 5% to 10% of your monthly salary.
*   **Internet Connection**: A reliable internet connection is essential for remote work. You can expect to allocate around 1% to 2% of your monthly salary for your internet plan.
*   **Electricity Bill**: Working from home typically leads to increased electricity consumption. Your monthly electricity bill might account for around 1% to 2% of your monthly salary.
*   **Office Supplies**: Ensure you have a comfortable and functional workspace. Generally, about 1% of your monthly salary is allocated for office supplies such as a desk, chair, and stationery.

Remember that these percentages are estimates and can vary based on your personal situation and choices. Some may add gym memberships or educational expenses like English courses or training platforms to these, so include whatever you need in your calculations. Ultimately, the goal is that when you lay out the numbers in "black and white," the final amount remaining in your pocket not only gives you peace of mind but also allows you to plan for a better future.

Proper financial management is crucial for maintaining solid financial stability as a contractor in Latin America. I always recommend setting aside a percentage for savings and planning long-term, considering investment alternatives that could even serve as a retirement plan.

For reference, several recruitment companies publish annual salary benchmarks. You might want to review these, including specific countries that pique your interest:
