Dreaming of an international tech career? 🌍 In this video, Guilherme and I share our 15+ years of industry experience, revealing how we prepared our profiles for companies in the United States and Europe. This is the first video in Portuguese, but I am also including Spanish subtitles.

We discuss:

*   English: It's the foundation! Fluency and self-confidence are key.
*   Focus and Resume: Stop being a "full-stack for everything" and specialize your profile. Your resume and LinkedIn are your gateway.
*   Interviews: Be concise, highlight your achievements, and don't shy away from difficult questions.
*   Work Culture: Prepare for flatter organizations where initiative is valued.
*   AI and the Future: How artificial intelligence is redefining roles and the importance of adaptability.

It's a marathon, not a sprint, but the reward is significant! Prepare, learn, and conquer the global market.
