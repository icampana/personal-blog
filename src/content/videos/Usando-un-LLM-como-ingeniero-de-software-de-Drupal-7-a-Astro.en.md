I recently undertook a project that, under normal circumstances, no one would typically choose: a legacy Drupal 7 site, unsupported, undocumented, and with components that no longer compile. I selected it precisely for that reason—it was the perfect scenario to showcase the true capabilities of LLMs when leveraged as software engineers, rather than mere random code generators.

This was not ad-hoc coding. It was a guided process: planning, review, technical decision-making, and step-by-step execution. Following this methodology, we successfully migrated everything to Astro, React, and a modern stack, tackling issues that would have taken days or weeks to resolve independently.

And that key distinction—between improvising with AI and strategically partnering with it—is precisely what I aim to demonstrate today.
